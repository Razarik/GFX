# Ray Tracing

This project contains code and scenes made for the course I-Computer Graphics in the Master's Year of the education
Applied Engineering (Electronics-ICT) at the University of Antwerp.

### Setup

There is not a lot of setup involved. In **configuration.properties**, set the right values for the screen resolution,
the rounding error you want to allow, and the recursive depth of rebounded rays.

Afterwards, you can begin creating your world and pass the finished object to the renderer. Some sample scenes are
contained in the Worlds class and can be passed to the renderer for visualisation. Pictures of a few of those are shown
here.
